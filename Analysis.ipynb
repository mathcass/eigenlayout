    "I originally started this project in mid-2016 after being inspired by a similar application in facial recognition. In facial recognition, applying PCA to a group of images gives you \"eigenfaces\" so I reasons, \"Could we see something similar in websites and could it give insight into common patterns for building products online?\" \n",

    "As mentioned, I wrote code to collect this data from the web using PhantomJS and GNU `make`. Here public links to the collected datasets:\n",
